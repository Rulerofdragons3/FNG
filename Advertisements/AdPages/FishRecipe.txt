[font_size=36]Recipe of Chocolate Fish[/font_size]

Fish alone can be so boring. What it lacks is that sweet flavor that only chocolate provides. This recipe may seem far-fetched, but I promise you're probably a good one!

Ingredients:
	- Fish (Any variety, chub used in example)
	- Chocolate

Cooking Instructions
First, you need to heat chocolate to 400 degrees Kevin.
Then when chocolate reaches red hot state, quickly dump on top of fish
Season with additional chocolate if desired.
Serve once cooled, rinse with ice having water if in a hurry.

This dish is one that the friends and family will be sure to enjoy!
