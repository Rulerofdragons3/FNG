[font_size=30]What they have been hiding[/font_size]
The governments of the world have been hiding a cancer that has rooted itself near the southern pole.
We assume the governments have been compromised by the Brotherhood of Spilled Blood, or choose to remain ignorant. 
The Dread Sea is a pit of raw carnal evil, and if the disease is left untreated it will result in the doom of humanity.




[font_size=30]Our Mission[/font_size]
We aim to cleanse the shadowy waters of the Dread Sea,
purifying its tainted waters and restoring its former beauty.
However, the darkness grows as the Brotherhood of Spilled Blood continue their wicked performances.
The performers are abundant in the sea's waters, and need extermination.

We will not allow another catastrophie begin.




[font_size=30]What you can do[/font_size]
We are always looking for high-skill fishermen to support our cause, and offer high payouts to each fish caught.

Every rod helps. 

However, the sea has taken many unready victims, so we cannot show give the location of the Dread Sea until specific requirements are met.


To join the C.U.L.T. and learn of the Dread Sea's whereabouts, you must:
	- Have access to the Deep End
	- Have caught a Forsaken
	- Pledge permanent loyalty to our cause
